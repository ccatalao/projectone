A survey of 4,207 apprentices identified key underpinning themes expressed in the students\u2019 accounts of their experience of working alongside scientists in the workplace. This nationwide profiling was combined with an ethnographic observation of the activities, interactions and discourses between scientists and students at the research laboratories of the Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology of the University of Porto (Ipatimup). The presentation will show how science communication at the workplace provides young students with opportunities for first-hand contact with the processes of science, the cultural environment in which these unfold and, ultimately, the social implications of their application to real-world problems.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n  \r\n        <div class=\"article\">\r\n          <p>\r\nAccess the research paper here:<p>\r\n<a href=\"https://carloscatalao.com/pdf/paper/LSWE_IJSS.pdf\">Download the pdf</a>\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n</body>",

It addresses the case phenomena both in their naturally occurring setting (a research laboratory), and within the broader framework in which they unfold: the Portuguese Ci\u00eancia Viva Summer Science Internships. This was carried out by linking a nationwide profiling of the programme \u2013 grounded both in demographic data and in the students\u2019 subjective ratings and perceptions \u2013 with the participant observation of a group of students working as apprentices in the research laboratories of the Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology of the University of Porto (Ipatimup).\r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"article\">\r\n          <p>\r\nField work was carried out over a period of three consecutive years, combining case study and survey with a range of interconnected qualitative methods, such as observation, interviewing and document analysis. Within the framework of a mixed-methodology research design, coding procedures provided the analytical techniques with which to address the qualitative data, whereas statistical analysis was used to explore and eventually reinforce generalizability.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"article\">\r\n          <p>\r\nThe implications of taking on board science and technology practitioners to improve science education are discussed. It was found that the input of the scientific community provides opportunities for youngsters, particularly the highly motivated ones, to have first hand contact with the processes of science, the social environment in which these unfold, and ultimately the social implications of their application to real-world problems. The characterization of scientists teaching and students learning in the science workplace will, it is hoped, lay the foundation for an interplay between science and school science.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"article\">\r\n          <p>\r\nAccess the full PhD Thesis here:<p>\r\n<a href=\"https://carloscatalao.com/pdf/phd/LearningScience_phd_ALL.pdf\">Download the pdf</a>\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n</body>",
